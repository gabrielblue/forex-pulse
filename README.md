## Security Setup

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and set:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
VITE_MT5_BRIDGE_URL=<bridge_url_or_leave_default>
```

Do not commit real keys. Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in the frontend.

Run migrations to enforce RLS policies:

```
supabase db push
```

Review Supabase Auth security settings:
- Enable leaked password protection
- Set OTP expiry to 60‚Äì120 seconds

See Supabase docs for recommended production hardening.
